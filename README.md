Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography

Overview
This project implements an image-based steganography technique to securely hide and retrieve messages within digital images. It provides an additional layer of security by combining encryption with steganographic techniques, ensuring secure communication without altering the perceptual quality of the cover image.

Features
Image Steganography: Hide text messages within image pixels without noticeable distortion.
Encryption & Decryption: Ensures secure transmission by encoding messages with a passcode.
Lossless Data Embedding: Maintains image quality while storing hidden messages.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on any system supporting Java and OpenCV.
User-Friendly Interface: Command-line interaction for easy encryption and decryption.
